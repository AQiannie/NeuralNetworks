Neural Network Toolbox
======================


This is a repository containing several state-of-the-art methods in the field of Neural Networks. Inspired by 
scikit-learn style - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/, the code files are easy-to-use and 
flexible to different datasets. Each folder hosts one algorithm with an example file demonstraing its usage. 

Current available algorithms,

  + Multi-layer Perceptron (contains classifier, regressor and sparse auto-encoder)

To be uploaded soon,

  + Extreme Learning Machines

  + Convolutional Neural Network (in draft mode)
