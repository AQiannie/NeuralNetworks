Neural Network Toolbox
======================


This is a repository containing several state-of-the-art methods in the field of Neural Networks. Inspired by 
scikit-learn style - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/, the code files are meant to be easy-to-use and 
flexible to different datasets. Each folder hosts one algorithm with an example file demonstraing its usage. 

Current available algorithms are,

  +  Multi-layer Perceptron

  +  Sparse Auto-enoders

  + Extreme Learning Machines

  + Deep Belief Network

  + Convolutional Neural Network (in draft mode)


More algorithms will be uploaded soon!
